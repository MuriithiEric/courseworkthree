- A .vue file is a custom file format that uses HTML-like syntax to describe a portion of the UI
- A vue file consists of a template, script, and style (language blocks)
- So in SFC's, we are essentially separating these language blocks into individual files
- HTML stores the view.
- The script block is where the logic and functionality of the app is maintained(JS).
- The CSS is the style section.
- The browser doesn't know what .vue file is, so webpack with the view loader is going to parse this file, extract the 3 blocks, pipe them through other loaders if necessary and finally assemble them back into a format that browsers understand.
- A .vue file is called a SFC, and the folders are called components because they can contain one or more components.
- Props are custom attributes you can register on a component.
- Any value can be passed to any prop, we can access the value on the component instance.
- Components are reusable Vue instances with custom HTML elements, that's why we use them.
- Slots are reserved space offered by vuejs to display content passed down from one component to another.
- Slots are reserved for html templates.
